# image-rendering

  This is a small C++ program to load pixel data (i.e., RGB values) of a 24-bit bitmap into a 2D array and then render the pixels. Please find the source code and executable attached. 

Usage: 
Go to Image/Image/ directory
double click "comand_prompt". This brings up command prompt. 
Type "Image.exe test1.bmp"

This would display the image on the console. You can pass any 24-bit bitmap as argument.
